# The ultimate _Civilization IV_ experience

_Rise of Mankind: A New Dawn_ is a new sequel of the great _Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword_ game. _A New Dawn_ serves as a new expansion, adding a huge and balanced new technology tree, putting emphasis on new buildings, new units and new technologies.<br>
<br>
Based on the incredibely popular former _Rise of Mankind_ mod, developped by _Zappara_, this extension put _Civilization IV_ even further. It contains a powerful new AI, charismatic new leaders, revolts and revolutions of the people, adaptative difficulty, advanced diplomacy, automatised defense tasks, and so much other enhancements... In short, that is nearly a whole new game.<br>
<br>
Last, but not least, it is built to be as flexible as possible, so you can choose whatever new option you like, and uncheck those you like a little less (if any...).<br>
<br>
**You always play the game you like.**<br>
