# The ultimate Civilization IV experience

Rise of Mankind: A New Dawn is a new sequel of the great Civilization 4: Beyond the Sword game. A New Dawn serves as a new expansion, adding a huge and balanced new technology tree, putting emphasis on new buildings, new units and new technologies.<br>
<br>
Based on the incredibely popular former "Rise of Mankind" mod, developped by Zappara, this extension put Civilization IV even further. It contains a powerful new AI, charismatic new leaders, revolts and revolutions of the people, adaptative difficulty, advanced diplomacy, automatised defense tasks, and so much other enhancements... In short, that is nearly a whole new game.<br>
<br>
Last, but not least, it is built to be as flexible as possible, so you can choose whatever new option you like, and uncheck those you like a little less (if any...).<br>
<br>
**You always play the game you like.**<br>
