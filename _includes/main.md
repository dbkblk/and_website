# The ultimate _Civilization IV_ experience

_Rise of Mankind: A New Dawn_ is a new sequel of the great _Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword_ game. _A New Dawn_ serves as a new expansion, adding a huge and balanced new technology tree, putting emphasis on new buildings, new units and new technologies.<br>
<br>
Based on the incredibly popular former mod  _Rise of Mankind_, _A New Dawn_ transforms _Civilization IV_, reaching to new heights and giving the players the best _Civilization_ experience of all time.
It contains a powerful and vastly superior new AI, charismatic new leaders and a new revolt and revolutions system. The huge amounts of new content also includes an advanced and reworked diplomacy system, a myriad of new automation options, an adaptive difficulty, and many other enhancements.

In short, this is THE _Civilization_ game of the future. It's the work of hundreds of talented individuals over many years. The result truly does feel like _A New Dawn_!<br>
<br>
Last, but not least, it is built to be as flexible as possible, so you can choose whatever new option you like, and uncheck those you like a little less (if any...).<br>
<br>
**You always play the game you like.**<br>
