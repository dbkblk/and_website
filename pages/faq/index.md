: _A New Dawn_ is an expansion mod for _Civilization IV_, sometimes abbreviated AND, RAND, AND2 or ROM:AND.

 <br> 
**Will the game play slow on my computer ?**
: If you can run _Beyond the Sword_, this expansion should work flawlessly.

 <br> 
**Will you add feature X to the game ?**
: Please suggest your idea on the forum.

 <br> 
**What features will be in your next version?**
: The extension is in stabilisation phase, but it can integrate new features. If any, announcements will be on the forum.

 <br> 
**Is _A New Dawn_ available in any other languages than English?**
: Yes. [_Please refer to this link._]({{ site.url }}/pages/features/#translated-in-several-languages)

 <br>
**Does the expansion work on a _Mac_?**
: Not on the official Mac version. Maybe through _Wine_ emulation of the _Windows_ version, but it's untested.

 <br>
**Does the expansion work on _Linux_?**
: Yes, through _Wine_, but... there's no official documentation to install it yet. Informations can be found [_HERE_](http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=541004) and [_HERE_](http://forums.civfanatics.com/showpost.php?p=13196031&postcount=122).

# _Installation problems_

**When I press _Launch Civilization IV_ in the launcher, nothing happens.**
: Firstly, please report your experience on the forum. Secondly, try to tick "Launch the mod with the game by default" in the options.

 <br>
**I started up my game, but nothing appears different!**
: Check the civilopedia for a new section at the end labeled "A New Dawn Concepts". If it is there, everything installed correctly. If not, be sure you installed everything correctly.

 <br>
**When I tried to install _A New Dawn_, I got an error message that said "bad end of central directory record"**
: This occurs when the download of the offline installer is interrupted, which can happen for a variety of reasons. Redownload the mod and try again.

<hr>
# _Graphical problems_

**I installed _A New Dawn_ correctly, but in game, the terrain flickers and is black!**
: The new graphic algorithm shouldn't have bug, if you get a graphical problem, please report on the forum.

 <br>
**When I start the game up, the interface is all gone! I can't select anything!**
: This occurs with bad installs. Make sure you've carefully [_followed the installation instructions_]({{ site.url }}/pages/install/).

# _Bugs_

**I think I found a bug in _A New Dawn_, what do I do?**
: Our team is composed, mainly, of humans. We make mistakes. So [_please report the bug on the forum thread_](http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=474185) ! A screenshot and/or a save, along with your _ANewDawn.log_ (located in "My Documents/Beyond the Sword/Logs/") would also be helpful.

# _Mod configuration_

**Where can i configure all the options ?**
: There are three ways to choose features in this expansion:

- **In the launcher**: Just open it, go to options. There you can find graphical options (interface color, terrain textures, formations,...).
- **When you are going to start a new game**: When you load the mod, go to _Custom Game_ to start a new game, then select the features / options that you want to activate. Note that there is an explanation popup for each option when you hover the mouse over a tickbox.
- **Directly in-game**: Once you've loaded a game, click on the _ladybird_ icon at the upper left of the screen (or press _CTRL_ + _ALT_ + _O_) and wait for the window to open. There are three differents types of parameters in the various tabs:
1. *RevDCM* allows you to configure all the aspects relative to the revolutions, barbarian civilizations, dynamic civilization naming, etc.
2. *A New Dawn* contains all the options that should affect all other aspects of the gameplay and some graphical options.
3. *All the other tabs* are used to configure all the graphical aspects of the interface (from the _BUG_ project)

 <br>
**What if I don't like some of your features, can I play without them?**
: Absolutely! Just choose what you like and play.
