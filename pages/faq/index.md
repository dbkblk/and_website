<p style='color:red'><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE: THIS FAQ IS NOT YET UP-TO-DATE</strong></p>

**I started up my game, but nothing appears different!**
: Check your Civilopedia for a new section at the end labeled "A New Dawn Concepts". If it is there, everything installed correctly. If not, be sure you installed everything correctly.

**I installed A New Dawn correctly, but in game, the terrain flickers and is black!**
: Although the cause is not known (I suspect users are running out of VRAM), the solution is either to remove some of the new civilizations from the Mega Pack out of the Rise of Mankind/Assets/Modules/Custom Civilizations folder OR only use FULL or LITE RoM.

**When I start the game up, the interface is all gone! I can't select anything!**
: This occurs with bad installs. Go back to the Directions and try again.

**When I tried to install A New Dawn, I got an error message that said "bad end of central directory record"**
: This occurs when the download is interrupted, which can happen for a variety of reasons. Redownload the mod and try again.

**What is a A New Dawn (RAND)?**
: A New Dawn is an expansion mod of Rise of Mankind

**There are features that I want/don't want. How do I turn them on/off?**
: There are three ways to choose features in this modpack:

- The first one is through installation process. When you install, there are list of features that you can choose from to be installed.
- Second, when you load the mod, you should go to Custom Game and go to the options below the default options there. There will be more features for you to choose from.
- Third, you will be able to use BUG Options Screen's tab named "A New Dawn". There will be even more features in there. Also, don't forget to check out other choices in other tabs as well.

**What if I don't like some of your features, can I play without them?**
: Absolutely! I will never force users to play with a specific features. Every feature can be turned off or disabled.

**RoM plays slow on my computer, won't all this new content slow the game down even more?**
: No! I've fixed most of the things that cause Rise of Mankind to play slower. Even if you install all the extra components, you should still experience a 10-20% speed boost from standard Rise of Mankind.

**I think I found a bug in A New Dawn, what do I do?**
: Report it! A screenshot and/or a save, along with your A New Dawn.log (located in your base Rise of Mankind folder) would also be helpful.

**Will you add feature X to your Mod?**
:  I do take feature requests, as long as they are feasible.

**What features will be in your next version?**
: I list all the new features in my beta's, check out that thread.

**Is A New Dawn available in any other languages than English?**
: Yes. Most of the text has been translated into German and French. Iff you can translate the text for me, I will gladly add it in the next version.

**How do I get A New Dawn to work on a Mac?**
: 
- Step 1: Throw your Mac out the nearest window
- Step 2: Buy a PC

**If I want to send you a donation, where do I send it?**
: I can not take donations, but if you feel obligated to pay for this mod, send a donation to Amnesty International.
