# Smart and balanced technology tree

<center><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/feat_techtree2.jpg"></center>
<center>A excerpt of the new tech tree</center>

**New technologies**
: The technology tree has been heavily reworked to be well balanced between usefulness, historical accuracy, research costs, buildings, civics and units delivered. The realistic timescale algorithm ensure that great discoveries are more or less in phase with the real historical dates. Countless new technologies have been added.
  
**New units**
: Hunt lions with the new early slinger, control the ocean with the attack submarine, charge your foes with the mounted cavalry or send an intercontinental missile. Every unit is thought to be useful and not superfluous.
  
**New buildings & wonders**
: From the early apiary to the vertical farms, develop your cities and please your people with new buildings.
Draw in the Lascaux caves, found the hanseatic league or create the olympic games, everything is possible in A New Dawn !
  
**Totally rebalanced with the community feedback**
: New buildings, civics, units, wonders has been discussed, modified, updated to look for the perfect balance. It will continue to evolve as the expansion is in continuous development.
  
**Disable what you don't like**
: If you don't want to play in the new futuristic era or don't like to be embarrassed by nukes, you can disable both the options.

# Revolutions

**Empire stability**
: Every decision you make in terms of civics or war acts can lead your people to make strike movements, revolts or even ask for independance. Will your iron fist be solid enough not to bend against your people will ? Will you be a loving and good president ?

**Minor civilizations**
: The game can be started as minor civilizations. Everyone is at war and no diplomacy is possible until the discovering of the writing. Then, you can try to make peace with your evolved peers, but war can leave unfortunate traces.

**Barbarians evolve !**
: Barbarians cities can emerge to minor civilizations as the game evolve. A new leader will settle with a brand new army. Don't underestimate them, as they can get up to your technology level, and may be, later, the future dominant civilization. 

**Dynamic civ names**
: (*Only works in English and French*) Following the civics chosen by their leaders, civilization can get new names. You might meet the "abyssinian great kingdom", the "english principality", the "arabian city-state of Mecca" or the "mayan rebels".


**Absorb your vassals**
: If a vassal becomes too small to evolve, even with the master's help, it might asks to be absorbed by the master and retreat.

# Advanced Diplomacy

<center>Qin Shi Huang doesn't seems to want an agreement today</center>
**Diplomacy pushed to the limit**
: New depth and realism makes the diplomacy more dangerous and important than ever. The AI is fully aware of all the new diplomacy options, and will trade for them, or in return for them.

**Set an embassy**
: Embassies are a vital agreement that must be made before open borders or any form of alliance can be made with any other civilizations.

**Sign a right to pass**
: Rights of passage are a limited form of open borders. They only allow non-combatants and trade through the borders.

**Use contact as a merchandise**
: Players can sell contacts with other civilizations, if they have not met the third party.

**Cease all relations with**
: Players can pay for civilizations to cease all contact with enemy civilizations - more effective than embargos.

**Pay war reparations**
: Players can pay war reparations and rebuild relations with former enemies.

**New trading options**
: Workers or heavy military units, like aircrafts, ships, and siege machineries can be bought and sold to other players. You can even sell and buy corporations' headquarters.

**Foreign policies**
: Choose a foreign policy civic. Will you avoid others to develop their trade routes ? or will you ask the tithe to the weakers ? or maybe dominate the market world ? YOU decide, but be warned of the consequences.

# Brand new AI

**Smarter AI**
: A lot of work has been put on artificial intelligence by the Civilization 4 community. Thanks to this, the AI benefits from bugfixes, enhanced ability to perform coordinated actions, to take economic decisions and will play better to the victory !


**New AI memory**
: The AI will know when you start lots of wars between others, or when you backstab a good friend. Don't expect them to forgive you for being manipulative. However, deciding NOT to declare war when asked may grant you better relations with the targeted nation.

# Brand new graphics
**Cultural diversity**
: <center><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/feat_cultural.jpg"></center>
Each civilization has its history and traditions. Cultural diversity is a module that reflect graphically this profusion.

**Terrain textures sets**
: <center><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/feat_textures.jpg"></center>
Are you bored by the default terrain textures ? The mod compiles the best textures ever created for the game through 5 sets: Original, A New Dawn, Blue Marble, Sparth and Vincentz.

**Formations**
: <center><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/feat_formations.jpg"></center>
Do you feel battles are a little too quiet ? Activate the formation setting to replace the three usual graphical units by a horde of units.

# Adaptative difficulty
<center><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/feat_difficulty.jpg"></center>
<center>Leave him alone ! He's angry !</center>
**Flexible difficulty**
: The flexible difficulty algorithm set handicaps for the humans and the AI relatively to the score. Thus, low score civilizations will get bonus and high score's will get handicaps. The game difficulty will then dynamically adapt to your skill, to ensure you will get a challenging but balanced game.

**Ruthless AI**
: The ruthless AI will be manipulative and harder to beat than normal. It will use techs and gold to hire war allies, often sparking small border disputes into raging world wars that ultimately will work to their advantage. It will always hit where it hurts.

**Do you want more challenge ?**
: We have been thinking of you ! Three options can make your game a challenge; *Final five* which remove the civilization with the lowest score every 50turns; *High to low* which push you in control of the lowest score civilization every time you reach the highest score (3 times limit); or *Increasing difficulty* which increases the difficulty level every 50 turns until you reach the ultimate level, deity.

# Fully customizable interface

<center>The domestic advisor resume invaluables cities informations</center>
**Redefined interface**
: The fully customizable interface is the accomplishment of the community BUG project, which sets the Civilization IV interface to a new level. In doing so, the expansion is set to show precious informations about your rivals (power, religion, resentment...), right besides the score. Advisors are now really detailled.

**Not enough ?**
: BUG adds tons of customization so you can add any information you want to the advisor' screens.

- **New speeds**: If you find a specific era too fast to enjoy it, you might love the new snail speed. If you want a quick-game, then try the new blitz speed !
- **New map scripts**: Several new map scripts have been added, from the inland sea of mediterranea to the smartmap generator. Every map will be different !
- **Multiple production & research**: In case of excedent of production or research, the overflow will be used for the next production or research during the same turn.
- **Realistic culture spread**: Culture spreads based on the terrain, faster on clearlands and slower over peaks and dense vegetation, with more intermediate cultural levels.
- **Technology diffusion**: Discovered technologies are slowly diffused through borders and commercial routes as soon as more and more civilizations have discovered it.

- **Advanced cargo mod**: Modern ships can now carry guided missiles and rockets while modern carriers can carry all the aircrafts except heavy bombers.
- **Defender retreat**: Defending units with a withdraw chance can eventually retreat backward towards a safe tile.
- **Fixed borders**: Use forts to generate culture and claim frontier lands or protect your lands with theirs zone of control to force the enemy to siege.
- **Assimilation**: When a city is captured, it retains the personality of the former owner, so his unique unit and building in that city can be build instead of conquerant's own.
- **Usable mountains**: The discover of "mountaineering" allows to cross mountains, so it can allow crucial strategic moves for early discoverers.
- **Medieval guilds**: Guilds are a medieval variant of corporations which can be spread all over the world. They add maintenance fees that go on pair with the new guild civic.
- **Modern corporations**: Modern corporations expand the amount of corporations in the late game, giving new opportinuties to economically overpass your peers.

- **Fine-tuned automations**: Many new automations like 'automated patrol' or 'protect borders' avoid to having the need to micro-manage your empire.
- **Mastery victory**: Mastery victory is the ultimate victory condition. Players must survive to the end of time and spread their culture, religion and power over the world.
- **AIAutoPlay**: Ever wanted to let the AI play your empire ? Or wanted to start with a settled empire ? Let the AI play for some turns, then take the control back.
- **Units per tiles**: Tiles can be set to host a limited number of units. It creates a whole new strategic dimension to the game. *Unfortunately, this option is unstable under 20units/tile.*
